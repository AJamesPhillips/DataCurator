# Installation

## Mac

* `git`, which can be installed via:
  * [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  * [brew](https://brew.sh/)
  * [install directly](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* an [account on GitHub](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up)
* `Node` (runs javascript on your computer like a headless browser)
  * Iâ€™d go for installing [node version manager via brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nvm), then using `nvm` to install the latest version of `node` using `nvm install`
* `yarn`, which once you have `node` installed, you can use: `npm install -g yarn`

At this point you can move to the [README.md](./README.md) and follow the "Setup" instructions.
