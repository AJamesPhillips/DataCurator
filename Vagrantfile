  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
  # config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"

  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
  # config.vm.box_check_update = false

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network "public_network"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
    vb.gui = false
    vb.name = "learning_reactjs_webpack_ubuntu16"

    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    vb.memory = "2048"
  end

  # Assign this VM to a host-only network IP, allowing you to access it
  # via the IP. Host-only networks can talk to the host machine as well as
  # any other machines on the same network, but cannot be accessed (through this
  # network interface) by any external networks.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "33.33.22.22"
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3000, host: 3000  # dev server
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5001, host: 5001  # dev server

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  vagrant_guest_synced_folder = "/vagrant"
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", vagrant_guest_synced_folder

  # Provision the development environment
  config.vm.provision :ansible do |ansible|
    ansible.playbook = "deploy/site.yml"
    ansible.extra_vars = {
      "vagrant_guest_synced_folder" => vagrant_guest_synced_folder,
    }
  end

  # Provision production
  # config.vm.provision :shell do |shell|
